Hi, I'm Jamie Arenella!
I'm currently studying web development but am also interested in game dev on the side
I'm interested in learning more about object oriented coding.
In the future I'd like to look more into: C++, C#
I'm open to collaborating on just about anything!
Currently I am most familiar with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Lua, JQuery, BootStrap, and Bulma
